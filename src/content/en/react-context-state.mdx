# Redux? Not for this.

I often see over-engineered portfolios using Redux or Zustand. For this project, I decided **React Context API** was the right tool due to its simplicity and zero extra dependencies.

## My Implementation: UIContext

I needed to control "Zen Mode" from anywhere (NavBar, Home, Footer).

```typescript
// contexts/UIContext.tsx
const UIContext = createContext<UIContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function UIProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [isZenMode, setIsZenMode] = useState(false);

  // Logic to persist or reset
  return (
    <UIContext.Provider value={{ isZenMode, toggleZenMode }}>
      {children}
    </UIContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Performance

To avoid unnecessary re-renders, I separated contexts that change frequently (like user inputs, if any) from those that change rarely (Theme, Language). Splitting state is key to using Context efficiently.
