# Less is More

Icons are vital for visual navigation. I chose **Lucide React** because:

1.  **Tree Shakable**: Only the icon I use is imported. If I use `<Menu />`, only that SVG enters the final bundle.
2.  **Adjustable Stroke**: I can control line thickness to match my typography.
3.  **Consistency**: All icons follow the same grid and visual style.

In the contact form, I use icons for visual feedback (a green check for success, a red alert for error). This improves cognitive accessibility, helping users understand application state instantly without reading text.
