# Automatic Magic

Framer Motion has a magic prop called `layout`. When you add it to a `motion.div` component, the library automatically detects changes in its position or size and animates the transition.

## The Use Case: Blog Filter

When you select a Tag on this blog, the list of posts reorders and filters. Without animation, it would be an abrupt change.

```tsx
<motion.div layout className="grid gap-8">
  {filteredPosts.map(post => (
    <motion.article layout key={post.slug}>
       {/* content */}
    </motion.article>
  ))}
</motion.div>
```

Just by adding `layout`, the cards "glide" to their new positions. It's a small detail that immensely elevates the perceived quality of the application.
