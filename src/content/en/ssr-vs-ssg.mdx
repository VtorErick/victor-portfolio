# Static vs Server

In Next.js, we have several options for rendering content:
1.  **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Generated on every request.
2.  **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: Generated at build time.
3.  **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Regenerated every X time.

## My Choice: SSG

For a personal portfolio and blog, content doesn't change every second. Using SSG means Next.js builds pure HTML files during deployment.

### Advantages:
- **Extreme Speed**: The server only serves static files, computes nothing.
- **Cheap**: Can be hosted on any CDN.
- **Availability**: If the database (or CMS) goes down, the site stays online because it's static.

The pages of this blog (`/blog/[slug]`) are generated with `generateStaticParams`, creating a physical HTML page for each article at build time.
