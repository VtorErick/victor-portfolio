# The End of Floats

CSS Grid has revolutionized web design, and Tailwind makes it trivial. In the skills section of this portfolio, I use a responsive grid layout.

```tsx
<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 md:gap-8">
  {skills.map(skill => (
    <SkillCard key={skill.id} {...skill} />
  ))}
</div>
```

## Why Grid over Flexbox?

While Flexbox is one-dimensional (row OR column), Grid is two-dimensional. This allows me to align experience cards not just horizontally but vertically, creating more robust layouts that automatically adapt to screen size (`md:grid-cols-2`).

The `gap-6` utility handles spacing automatically, eliminating the need for negative margins or old hacks.
