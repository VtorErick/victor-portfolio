# Atomic Deployments

I hosted this project on Vercel. The feature I value most is **Deploy Previews**.

Every time I open a Pull Request on GitHub, Vercel creates a unique URL with that version of the site. I can share it, test it on my mobile, and verify visual changes without touching the production site.

Once code is merged to `main`, Vercel updates production instantly, invalidating the CDN cache globally. This infrastructure, which used to require a dedicated DevOps team, is now automatic.
