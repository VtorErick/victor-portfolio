# The Tech Stack

When I decided to revamp my portfolio, I knew I didn't just want a "pretty face." I wanted a platform that demonstrated engineering capability, performance, and scalability.

## The Core: Next.js 15 (App Router)

I chose **Next.js** for its hybrid rendering capabilities. Most of the site is **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for unmatched speed, but I maintain interactivity with client components (`"use client"`) where necessary, such as in the navigation bar or blog filters.

```typescript
// Example of Client Component for interactivity
"use client"

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function InteractiveComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  // ...
}
```

## Styling: Tailwind CSS v4

Development speed with Tailwind is superior. Plus, it allows for a consistent token-based design system.

- **Responsive Design**: Utility-first Grid and Flexbox.
- **Dark Mode**: Native support with `dark:` modifiers.
- **Glassmorphism**: `backdrop-blur` effects for a modern look.

## Strong Typing: TypeScript

No serious project exists without TypeScript. From defining portfolio data to React components, everything is typed to prevent compile-time errors and improve maintainability.

```typescript
interface Project {
  title: string
  description: Record<'es' | 'en', string>
  technologies: string[]
}
```

This stack is not just modern; it is the industry standard for high-level web applications.
