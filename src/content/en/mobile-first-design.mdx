# Creative Constraints

Designing for mobile first forces you to prioritize content. You don't have space for unnecessary embellishments.

## Tailwind and Breakpoints

In this project, I write base styles for mobile and use `md:` or `lg:` prefixes for large screens.

```tsx
// Small padding on mobile, large on desktop
<div className="p-4 md:p-10 lg:p-16">
```

This is better than "Desktop First" (using `max-width`), because the mobile browser doesn't have to process complex override rules; it simply reads the base. The result is lighter, more performant CSS on resource-constrained devices.
