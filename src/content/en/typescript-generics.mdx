# Beyond `any`

TypeScript shines when you use generics to build reusable tools. A clear example in this project is my handling of API responses or polymorphic components.

## The `contact-form` case

To handle the form, we define a type inferred from Zod. This ensures that if I change the validation schema, TypeScript automatically warns me if my component tries to access a field that no longer exists.

```typescript
type FormData = z.infer<typeof formSchema>

const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => {
  // data.email exists and is string
  // data.age would give compilation error
}
```

Type safety not only prevents bugs but acts as living documentation for my future self.
