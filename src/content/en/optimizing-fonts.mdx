# Goodbye Text Flicker

Have you noticed how on some websites the text changes font a second after loading? That's a "Flash of Unstyled Text" (FOUT) and it hurts experience and SEO.

## The `next/font` Solution

In this project, I use `Geist Sans` and `Geist Mono`.

```typescript
import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from "next/font/google";

const geistSans = Geist({
  variable: "--font-geist-sans",
  subsets: ["latin"],
});
```

Next.js downloads the font at build time and serves it from the same domain as the HTML. No more requests to Google Fonts delaying loading. The result is a **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) of 0**.
