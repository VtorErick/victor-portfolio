# Being Found

Having an amazing portfolio is useless if no one sees it.

## Metadata API

Next.js 15 makes SEO trivial with the Metadata API. Each page exports a `metadata` object.

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Blog - Victor Acosta',
  description: 'Technical articles...',
  openGraph: {
    images: ['/og-image.png'],
  },
}
```

This automatically generates `<meta>` tags for Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Additionally, I configured automatic generation of `sitemap.xml` which dynamically includes every new blog post I write, ensuring Google indexes my fresh content quickly.
