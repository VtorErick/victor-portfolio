# Designing "Zen Mode" 🧘

One of the most unique features of this portfolio is **Zen Mode**.

## What is it?

Modern web development often overwhelms the user with information. I wanted to offer a way to "turn off the noise." By clicking the eye icon in the navigation bar, the UI fades away, leaving only essential content and interactive backgrounds.

## Implementation with Context API

I used React Context to manage the global UI state.

```typescript
// src/contexts/UIContext.tsx
export function UIProvider({ children }) {
  const [isZenMode, setIsZenMode] = useState(false)

  const toggleZenMode = () => setIsZenMode(prev => !prev)

  return (
    <UIContext.Provider value={{ isZenMode, toggleZenMode }}>
      {children}
    </UIContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Animations with Framer Motion

To make it feel premium, nothing appears abruptly. Everything has a transition.

- **Scroll Reveal**: Elements appear smoothly (`fadeInUp`) as you scroll down.
- **Micro-interactions**: Buttons have scale effects on hover.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Particles and mathematical grids rendered in HTML5 Canvas.

The result is a web that feels "alive" and responds to every user interaction.
