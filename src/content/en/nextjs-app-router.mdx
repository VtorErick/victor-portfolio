# The Paradigm Shift

Next.js 13 introduced the App Router, and in version 15 (used in this site), it is the undisputed standard.

## Server Components by Default

In the `app/` directory, everything is a Server Component unless you say otherwise. This means:
- **0kb of JS** sent to the client for static components (like my Footer or Texts).
- Direct access to the database or file system (fs) without exposing secrets.

## Nested Layouts

The `layout.tsx` file allows me to define a persistent structure (like the NavBar) that doesn't unmount when navigating between pages, preserving scroll state and animations.

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <LanguageProvider>
           {children}
        </LanguageProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

This architecture drastically reduces First Contentful Paint (FCP).
