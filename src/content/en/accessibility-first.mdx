# The Web is for Everyone

Accessibility is not a "feature", it's a requirement. During the development of this portfolio, I ensured:

1.  **Semantic HTML**: Using `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>` and `<footer>` instead of just `<div>`. This helps screen readers understand the structure.
2.  **Focus Management**: All interactive elements (buttons, links) have clear `:focus-visible` states for keyboard navigation.
3.  **Color Contrast**: Checked that text and background colors (especially in dark mode and indigo color) met WCAG AA standards.

I even added a unit test (`a11y.test.tsx`) that uses `axe-core` to automatically audit that I don't break basic accessibility rules in every deploy.
