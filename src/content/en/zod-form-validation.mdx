# Trust in Data

Validating forms by hand is error-prone. In this project, I define a "schema" of what I expect to receive:

```typescript
const formSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Must be a valid email"),
  message: z.string().min(10, "Message is too short"),
})
```

React Hook Form uses this schema with `zodResolver`.
- **UX**: The user gets instant feedback as they type.
- **Security**: We avoid sending garbage data to the API.
- **DX**: TypeScript infers types automatically.

It's a perfect trinity of User Experience, Security, and Developer Experience.
