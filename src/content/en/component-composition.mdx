# The Art of Composition

In this portfolio, I avoided monolithic components. Instead, I use composition to build complex interfaces from simple pieces.

## The "Props Drilling" Problem

Passing props through multiple levels is tedious. Composition solves this by allowing components to be passed as `children`.

```tsx
// A generic Card component used in Education, Experience, etc.
export default function Card({ children, className }) {
  return (
    <div className={`rounded-xl border border-border bg-card p-6 ${className}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Slots Pattern

For more complex components like the `NavBar`, I defined "slots" or areas where content can be injected, keeping the layout agnostic to specific content.

Composition makes the code more declarative and easier to understand, a key principle in this project's architecture.
